ratio:
Two quantities which are being compared (a : b) are called its terms. The first term (a) is called antecedent and second term (b) is called consequent

Proportion: 
Equality of two ratios is called proportion. Consider the two ratios, a : b and c : d, then proportion is written as,
a : b :: c : d  (or)   a : b = c : d 
Here a, b, c, d are called Terms. a, d are called Extremes (end terms) and b, c are called Means (middle terms).
