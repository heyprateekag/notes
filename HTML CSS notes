*HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language to create web pages. Content display/structure

*CSS(Cascading Style Sheets): used for styling html elements.

*home page is given a name index.html, the page which gets loaded in the very beginning when we hit our domain.


*DOCTYPE tells the browser which kind(HTML5, XHTML, any version) of document it is. HTML5 is a standard. This must be the very first line in the html file.
<!DOCTYPE html> indicates HTML5 document. All versions have its own doctype.


*<head></head> tag contains information about your page not any display content of a webpage.


*anything which you want to show in the webpage, is placed inside <body></body> tag.


*ctrl+/ or ctrl+k+c  for comment


*to write the basic structure of html automatically in vs code, write ! then press enter, emmet will automatically write the structure of html code.


*to automatically load the html file in browser, whenever you save your html file, install vs code extention with name Live Server by Ritwick Dey and then click Go Live from bottom right of the vs code or right click on the file and then select Open with live server.


*meta tag doesnt appear on the page, they just tell details about the page.

<meta charset="UTF-8"> is famous meta tag, which tells the character set of the characters used in that page which is unary characters most of the time, well everything will still work if this meta tag is not present.
   
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> this meta tag is important, this is for the responsive layout

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> this is for browser compatibility.

<meta name="description" content="This is my website description"> this meta tag is quite important, this is not default one. When someone searches about your website then in your search engine, this description is displayed below to where your website link appears.

<meta name="keywords" content="app, app development"> this tag gives keywords to the website/page, years and years ago keywords used to hold a lot of importance in SEO but now they doesn't hold much importance, now SEO includes a lot of different things.

<meta name="robots" content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"> this meta tag is included if we don't want our website/page to come up in any search engine.

*<title> is important as most of the time whenever someone searches something on google then different site link comes and that link is made of the title of the page most of the time, so ideally you should give such keyword as your title with which you want your user to come to your webpage.

*to write in the next line by creating another line without going to the last of the current line, press ctrl+enter from wherever you are in current line.


*it is a good practice to give one h1 heading per page which could be any (heading for your page content for eg.)


*if one want to add dummy words to check a feature then we can write lorem+enter to write random number of words, for writing n number of words shortcut, lorem19+enter this will add 19 random words and we can add any number of words in place of 19.


*<strong> text in this tag will make that text bold, though we can change strong tag's property in our css file
<em> text in this tag will become italic, though we can change emphasis tag's property as well
<br> line break tag, changes the line of the text after it
<hr> tag will change the line and also adds the horizontal line in next line.
<b> <u> <i> <s> tags are now depricated as html is not meant for styling
<del> tag adds the strike to the text inside it.

*if you want to copy the current line to next line then do shift+alt+down arrow key
*if you want to take your cursor beyong a word then use ctrl+right arrow key or left arrow key if you want to go back
*if you want to take current line to any other line then while being on the line press alt+down/up arrow key

*<a> is an inline element which mnz it will not change the line after it. The opposite is the block element which changes the line after it.
We don't want user to go away from our website, so we should make sure if a user clicks on a link then that link should open in new window. For that we have to write a target attribute in <a> tag.
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google on new tab.</a>
we can also link another html file from our system in this <a> tag.
# in href means user will remain in the same page after clicking that link.

*for remote random images add this link in your src of img tag https://source.unsplash.com/random/1920x1080/?wallpaper,cartoon
you can change keywords passed according to your requirement


*<!-- Unordered List (generally used) -->
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
  </ul>

to remove the default bullets or to change the bullets styling:
list-style: none;//for no bullets in ul tag style attribute

*for ordered list
<ol> tag is used and rest is same as ul tag
type is the attribute of <ol> which defines the order 
type="a" for a,b,c,... "A" for A,B,C,.... "i" for i,ii,iii,iv,... "1" for 1,2,3,... "I" for I,II,III,IV,....
<ol type="a"></ol>

*nested list can be created inside any list tag
<ul>
	<li> Item 1 </li>
	<li> Item 2
		<ul>
			<li> Item 2.1 <li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Item 3 </li>
</ul>

*for printing same thing for multiple lines, type li*4 for 4 li tags in 4 different lines

*Table
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>S.No</th>
        <th>First Name</th>
        <th>Last Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

*'for' attribute in label tag is added to add a feature which focuses on the input field when clicked on. So when we will click on the label then it will focus on the input field for which label is present. 'for' in label tag and 'id' in input tag should be same.


*input type contains text, number (which will contain increment and decrement arrow by default), date (which will contain date picker by default), radio (which will give the option to select just one option), checkbox (its like radio but in checkbox we can select more than one option)
dropdown is added with select tag
button contains type submit, reset(it will reset the form)

*if you want to select multiple occurences of the same text, select that text and press ctrl+d for next occurence of that text, cursor will point to both the locations, so that if you want to change at multiple locations then you just have to change once.
*if you want to move multiple lines/single line back tab position then select those lines and press shift+tab, if you want to move forward tab position then just press tab after selecting required lines.


*<p> has a styling by default which adds a margin after it by default.


* id and class don't have any functional difference when we want to consider them while styling but we don't really give same id to more than one tags, its not a good practice (though we can give if we want, we won't get any error). But we can give same class to more than one tags.


*the only differnce between span and div is that span is inline element and div is a block element.

*block level elements means elements which take whole row. element next to it will come in next row.

*&nbsp; is used to add one whitespace in the dom. We can use n number of &nbsp; to add n number of whitespaces. FullForm: Non Breaking SPace
&gt; is used for Greater Than angle bracket bcz some browsers will not be able to read normal angle bracket as they indicate start or end of any tag.
&gt = &#62, &lt = &#60
These are known as HTML entities. You can search them, there are many.

*if one wants to add a code snipet in the dom then he can use <code> tag to write his code in this tag which will look like a code in dom.


*to show keyboard keys, one can use <kbd> tag 


*Semantic tags: from ES5, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <main>, <article>, <aside> are used instead of using <div> everywhere. Those tags are known as Semantic Tags.
They doesn't add any styling by default, it's just that html code look much organized and readable after using these tags as it also gives idea about the content inside it.


*<style> tag is added inside <head> tag and after <title> tag if using Internal css.
selecter {
	property: value;
}
selector can be the tag name or class or id or pseudo selector.


*to link external css, write <link> tag in <head> tag
eg: <link rel="stylesheet" href="location.css">
External CSS is prefered.


*for tag name, we just use its name {}
for id, #idName{}
for class, .className{}


*to give same styling to multiple selectors,
.selectorName, .selectorName1, #id1 {
	
}


*nested selectors:
#id2 .class3{
	
}
This mnz apply styling in class 'class3' of id 'id2'

*default font size of a <html> is 16px.
*Times New Roman is the default font family used if you don't mention any font-family


*1px = (1/96)th of 1 inch
*
%: to Parent element
em: to font size of Parent element
rem: to font size of root element
vw: to 1% of viewport width
vh: to 1% of viewport height


*web safe font-family used as comma seperated names means that if browser doesn't recognize first font-family then it should take second if it doesn't recognize that too then the
third and so on but last font is very general so it will anyways take that
eg: font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;


*we can change the line height of the text by applying styling:
line-height: 1.6em
for bold text, we can use font-weight: bold;
for italic text, we can use font-style: italic;


*to write color in rgb:
color: rgb(0to255, 0to255, 0to255); (red, blue, green) 
if we will give first parameter 255 and others 0 then it will mean red and if there will be other parameters then it will mean the combination of those among red, blue, green
all 0s will be black and all 255s will be white
hexadecimal code
color: #ff0000 (this is also rgb; first 2 for red, second 2 for green, last 2 for blue)
we can use single characters as well, #f00 for red instead of #ff0000
all 0s will be black and all fs will be white
color-hex.com or htmlcolorcodes.com is a nice website for selecting color


*border-top-left-radius: 10px; for curving top left border
border is not necessary for curving the edges, one can curve the div without even border by the same styling


*for background image:
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
if our image dimensions are small then it will repeat by default. If one don't want that then use
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: center center; can be used to set the position of the image
backgound-size: cover; is used when our image is big but we are applying it in smaller area and we want whole image to cover and not crop by default.

we can write all the properties and its values in one line as
background: url('./img/stars.jpg') no-repeat center center/cover;

if you want your image to not move when scrolling then use
backgound-attachment: fixed;


*to reset all the default styling,
	* {
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
	}
	* for reseting every tag's default styling
	* can give any styling here which you want to set for all tags like color etc, but gets overriden by our own css, it just overrides the default styling

IMP
*green color indicates padding and orange indicates margin in dev tools of browser window.


IMP
*if we apply width to a element and also apply padding then its total width will be width+padding. If we want fixed width which we gave and adjust the inner elements according to that
then in the reseting block or in any tag in which we don't want default behavior(its just that in reseting block it will apply in all) we need to give:
box-sizing: border-box;
Mostly it happens that we give width according to our requirement but when we apply padding or margin then it goes out of our width, which should not happen


*if we have more than one same properties then further descriptive/down property (padding-top, padding-left, etc) will override the further up property (padding, etc)


*we can give descriptive property in one line as well:
padding: top right bottom left;
if we have same top, bottom and same left, right then,
padding: top/bottom left/right; eg. padding: 10px 20px; //top and bottom will be 10px, left and right will be 20px


EXTRA
if we write same styling with different value bottom to the first styling then below one will override the above one
padding: 29px
.
.
.
padding: 49px //this will override 29px padding


Important
*if one want to put something in center, then cover that in a container like <div class="container"></div> then 
give the following styling properties to the class
max-width: 960px;(or any other desired width)
margin: auto; //it will give equal margin from left and right


then it will move the elements inside container to the center
one should use max-width instead of width bcz if we will use width then even in small devices, its width will be the same so content will go outside of the view.
when max-width is used then in the view greater than that width, elements will acquire that width but in the view with lesser width than given width, elements will squeeze by itselft
according to the view width.
if we want the container to use width according to screen size then we can use value in % eg. max-width: 50% //this will keep the width of the container 50% to the screen no matter 
screen size but in px it will take the maximum width which it can take upto the mentioned width (960 in this case)


*if we want to align the text then text-align: property is used.
text-align: justify; is a suggestion bcz it will align the text to center but will keep the last line aligned left so it is a combination of align left and align center(better than 
either one).


*one should not use float nowadays as now we have things like flexbox and grid with which we can attain the same results. Flexbox and grid will be discussed later. Float creates problem in responsive view.


*another issue with float elements is, it needs to be cleared otherwise elements after it will be below those floated elements.
To clear those floated elements we need to add clr class like:
.clr {
	clear: both;
}
and after that we need to add a div after floated elements and give clr class to that div like:
<div class="clr"></div>
In 90% of the cases we will need this.


*by default <a> tag have underline under it, to remove that apply styling:
text-decoration: none;
to add styling on hover, we can write styling as:
a:hover {
	//styling properties
}
to add styling on the visited links, 
a:visited {
	//styling properties
}

These are known as different states of the link, active is also the one.


*we can apply hover property to any class:
.className:hover {
	//styling properties
}


*pseudo selectors can be applied on last item, first item or the alternate items like:
.side-menu li:last-child {
	//styling properties      
}


*float:left applied to list items will put all items side by side in one line


*sometime applying float to the elements inside the div, hides the background styling of the div, to show the styling of the div, we should do overflow: auto in that div styling


*sometimes padding don't come in top and bottom if the div is just of one row, to change that we should make display property of the elements inside that div 'block' to contain those elements with their property.
display: block;


IMP
*margin: auto; moves the items to the center only if the element in which it is applied is block level.
inline element won't go to the center if applied margin: auto


*we can't apply width and margin to the inline element. If we want inline properties with the styling then we can use display: inline-block;


*position values:
Static: not affected by tblr(top, below, left, right) properties/values.
Relative: tblr values cause element to be moved from its normal position.
Absolute: positioned relative to its parent element that is positioned relative.
Fixed: positioned relative to the viewport. Keeps same position even after scrolling.
Sticky: positioned based on scroll position. Position can be set when scrolled like the navbar.


*if we want element to be positioned according to the parent/outer element then we can give position: relative to the parent element and position: absolute to the child/inner element and then can position it, then it will get positioned according to the parent element.


*if a element gets hiden by another element then we can give higher z-index of the element which we wanna show above. The higher z-index, the closer it will be to you.


*positioning is not done that much nowadays bcz it creates problem in the mobile devices/responsive view.


*When we don't want something to show in the dom at a certain condition then we should use the property visibility: hidden; instead of display: none; bcz display: none; will not take
its space and other elements will overtake its space but in visibility: hidden; its space will not be taken by other element but it will not be visible on the dom.
We can use any according to our requirement


*importance of the class is higher than the actual tag
for same importance level, importance grows as we go down in the styling.
This mnz if we have given different styling to the same element through different ways then styling given in the class will have higher importance than styling given in the tag.
if we have used same thing(tag or class) multiple times then as we go down the importance increases. This mnz styling given in the last tag/class will be implemented.

If we have used external css file and we want to give our property to the element then we can use !important in that property's value. So its importance will be highest.
color: blue !important;


*we can't use negative padding. We should avoid negative margin.


*we have to give color to the links specially, giving color to its div might not work. eg. if inside some div, I have a tag texts and I mention a color styling for that div, so it won't
work for the links present in that div, to set particular color to those links we have to target them seperately like .divClass a { color } or id/class of that <a> tag


*to get high quality images for your project:  www.pexels.com
*to get themes for your webpage/website you can refer www.themes.getbootstrap.com
or you can search for bootstrap themes


*following methods can be used to get responsive design:
	-set the viewport/scale
	-use fluid widths as opposed to fixed
	-media queries - different css styling for different screen sizes
	-rem units over px
	-mobile first method


*@media (max-width: 500px) {} screens with width 500px or less (anything under 500px) (generally used for smartphones) 
styling for that screen width can be written in this block

@media (min-width: 501px) and (max-width: 768px){} //screens with width 501px to 768px
768px is the width generally used for tablet

normal screen size lands between 769 to 1200 generally (not hard and fast rule)

@media (min-width: 1201px) {} for widescreens anything above 1200px width


*We generally see written @media only screen and (max-width: 500px) here only screen just indicates that media type is screen
not speech, but that is not very much required to mention therefore we can skip as well


*We should be writing a general styling which should be applied to those elements whose styling is not mentioned in the given 
screen sizes.
We can give min/max-height in place of width and can apply styling for a particular height or a range of height for landscape 
mode.


*We can also create a different stylesheet for a particular width range
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 768px)" href="fileName.css">
this link tag should be after the main stylesheet.
In this case, this css file will get loaded into the browser when screen hits mentioned size


*px is a fixed unit, number of px will be same for all the screen sizes.
whereas em and rem units are relative to different things:
em unit is relative to its parent element and rem unit is relative to its root parent element

if parent element has font-size of 20px then if we provide any value(font-size, margin etc) as 2em then its equivalent px size 
will be 2*20=40px. 

root parent(html) element has font-size of 16px. If we have not mentioned font-size in any parent then it will take root parent.
every element (like h1, p, etc) has predefined font-size value in em (1.1em for h1, 1em for p), but we can change them explictly.
but em becomes very confusing due to its behavior with its parent therefore its better to use rem as it will have only one 
parent i.e html.

We can just html tag have it's font size and we can give font-size to other child elements in the form of rem according to our
size requirement. They will be in multiple of 16px by default (if we have not changed font-size of html tag)
to make it responsive we can give font-size to html in % (62.5% will be 10px)


*Find benefit of rem and em units, the only benefit which I think is that by using rem and em units, if we want to increase or 
decrease the size of all the text then we just have to decrease the size of the parent element and the font size of all the 
other texts will change on its own. If we don't give em or rem units then we individually have to increase or decrease the font
 size of all the elements.

It said that these sizes are responsive but even if I give font size in px then too if I decrease the screen size, font size will decrease.
If we change the font size of the browser (from browser) then em units will not be affected bcz they are taking size from their parent element and changing the font size of the browser changes the font size of the root element


*vh/vw: viewport height/width is the height/width of the browser. A browser is divided into 100 parts horizontally and vertically.
 We can give height/width from 1-100vh/vw if we give 50vh then that element will take half of the browser's size. If we increase
 or decrease size of our browser, it will still cover half of that remaining size of the browser.
 Those 100 parts gets shrink down on decreasing the browser.


*If we add any value in percentage, then it takes that % space of it's container not the browser screen.


*How JS works behind the screen is to be studied and make notes of it.


*display: flex will align all the elements inside it, horizontally by default.
To keep them vertically, we need to add flex-direction: column;


*flex-wrap: wrap; moves the contents to the next line if screen size is reduced. Basically it adds responsiveness automatically.
Without this property, elements will gonna shrink. If we dont want a particular element to shrink then we can add flex-shrink: 0; 
to its styling


*flex-grow: 1; will automatically set the width to cover all the remaining space. If this is kept in all the elements then all 
will take equal width and will cover the width of the container.


*we can combine all the values in one property i.e flex: grow shrink basis; flex: 1 0 200px;


*align-items: center; align-items property applies to the flex-container and it aligns across the cross-axis. If flex-direction is row then align-items will align the items on vertical scale. 
By default result will not be seen as height of the container must be just the elements height, to see the effect one needs to increase the height of the container.
It also gives the value stretch which will stretch to complete height(if flex-direction: row) or width(if flex-direction: column) of the container.


*for main-axis align: use justify-content: center; It works same as align-items, just it aligns the elements on the main-axis (if flex-direction:row then horizontal, if flex-direction:column then vertical axis is the main-axis).


*align-self works on the individual elements. 


*Remove the opacity of the background from its elements:
.hero {
  background: url("../image_resources/showcase.jpg") no-repeat center
    center/cover;
  height: 100vh;
  position: relative;
  color: #fff;
}

.hero .content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 0 20px;
}

till now there is a simple background and some text over it
if we want to add a overlay to the background so that it doesnt look too flashy,

.hero::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
}

this will add a overlay of a faded black color, but this will also be applied over the text on the background.

.hero * {
  z-index: 10;
}

if we increase the z-index then all the contents on the background will come infront of the overlay.


* object-fit: cover; //it covers the image in our required dimentions without streching the image.


* to change the outline color of the input field when focused:
input:focus {
  outline-color: #28a745;
}


* to increase the size of the favicon icons, use fa-2x class to double the size.


* for restricting special characters and space in text input field
onkeypress="return (event.charCode > 64 && event.charCode < 91) || (event.charCode > 96 && event.charCode < 123) || (event.charCode==32)"
this can be applied to input tag, this will accept blank space too, no not accept blank space, remove 32 condition


* To apply horizontal scroll to the table
table{
    display: block;
    overflow-x: auto;
    white-space: nowrap;
} 


* For gradient background color:
background: linear-gradient(110deg, #fdcd3b 60%, #ffed4b 60%);


* for gradient background with image:
background: linear-gradient(-70deg, #fa7c30 30%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) 30%), url('planets.jpg');


* to apply line between some element of the design

.departments li:nth-child(5) {
  border-right: 2px dashed #811d77;
  padding-right: 14px;
  width: 14.1%;
}

.departments li:nth-child(6) {
  margin-left: 11.75px;
}
*when we dont want to increase the size of the div after applying padding in that div

apply box-sizing:border-box; in that div which will not increase size of that div


*To use font-awesome icons in your website, include this link in your header
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pro.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.10.0/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-AYmEC3Yw5cVb3ZcuHtOA93w35dYTsvhLPVnYs9eStHfGJvOvKxVfELGroGkvsg+p" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
You can take the latest link from https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/customizing-wordpress/snippets/setup-cdn-webfont


*when we add opacity in any div, then it is also applied to its text, image or any other element inside it. To avoid it, we need to use overlay which we will discuss later.



*If we want to change the border color when any input field is focused then we can do:
#contact-form input:focus,
#contact-form textarea:focus {
	outline: none;
	border-color: #3o83jk;
}


*Following are the ways through which we can achieve responsive view:
-Set the viewport/scale
-Use fluid(max/min) widths as oppose to fixed.
-Media queries: Different CSS styling for different screen sizes
-Rem units over px
-Mobile first method


*diagrams.net can be used to make flowcharts.


*div p {
//styling
}
targets p tag inside the div, but it will target all the p tags inside div including any <p> tag which is under any other
element, like <p> inside any <li> tag which is inside the div
<div>
	<p>styling applied to me</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>styling will be applied for this as well</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>
if we don't want that, we just want to target <p> which is/are directly under <div>, we can achieve that by
div > p {
//styling
}


*for targetting just next sibling/element
div + p {
	//styling
}
if we want to target <p> which is just after <div>
<div>
	//other stuff
</div>
<p>I will get targetted</p>


*If we want to style something with it's attribute, like if we want to target all the anchor tag <a> having attribute target
a[target]{
	//styling
}
to target any attribute with specific value
a[target='_blank']{
	//styling will be applied to all the anchor tag having target value as _blank
}


*CSS Grid provides 2-D grid layout to dom, it is similar to flexbox but more powerful, we can use align-items & justify-content
just as we use in flexbox.

display: grid; //creates grid
All direct child items are grid items

difference between flex and grid layout is that flex is not capable of 2D layouts, either it can set along a row or a column
with grid we can have 2D layouts
Its good to use grid for the outer layout of whole page

whatever style we will apply to grid will obviously affect our grid-items and that would be our requirement as well

<div class="parent">
	<div></div>
</div>

.parent{
	display: grid; //this alone will not do anything unline flex which moves the direct elements to one line
	grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px; //this will align direct child elements in three columns of 200px, if we will
											  //if we will have more than 3 direct child elements then they will go to next row
											  //and if we will have less than 3 columns then remaining columns will remain
											  //empty
	grid-template-columns: 200px auto 200px; //this will cover whole row making first and 3rd column of 200px width and middle
											 //column will take rest of the space of the window
	grid-template-columns: auto auto auto; or repeat(3, auto); //will give equal width to all the three rows and will cover
															   //complete row
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; //we generally use size in grid in fractions(fr), this will also cover whole row making
										//second column of double the size of 1st and 3rd
	grid-gap: 1rem; //to give margin space around grid items(top, bottom, right, left)
}
											
Rows:
.parent{
	display: grid;
	grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 3fr; //this will set direct children of the parent element, 1st element to particular default
									 //height second to it's double height, third it's triple height, if there will be more
									 //direct elements then they will be in their default height
	grid-auto-rows: 3fr; //this will set all the remaining child elements to three times of the default size
}


*For 2D, we will have to use both columns and rows
.parent{
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
	grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 3fr;
	grid-auto-rows: 3fr;
}
//this will create 2 columns of equal width covering whole width of the browser window, will give 1 times width to the first row
//2times to second row, three times to the third row, if there will be more than 6 items then they will get 3times height bcz of
//grid-auto-rows: 3fr


*If we don't want a regular, consistant layout but we want one item with our desirable column and row span
we can apply styling to that particular item by targetting it, other items will be set according to our regular layout

.particular-child-item{
	grid-column-start: 1;
	grid-column-end: 4; //this will start that item from first column and will take it till 4th column
	grid-row-start: 1;
	grid-row-end: 3; //this will start the item from first row and will take the item till 2nd row
}
it consider lines from the layout start, if we keep 4 as column end that 4 will be 4th line column wise, which will be starting
of 4th column
it will consider lines of our set regular layout


*In order to make it responsive or setting minimum and maximum columns width/row height
.parent{
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
}
this will not set the number of columns (bcz of auto-fit) but will set the minimum(300px here) and maximum (1fr here)
where ever it will see that window width is decreasing then it will send items to next row, keeping atleast 300px width of the
items, if window size is enough then it will set equal width of all the items

it is good for some usecases like image galary but not good for many usecases as no one would want 3 items in one row and 2 
items in another


*if we want to set our layout more easily, we can do that with grid-template-areas
.parent{
	display: grid;
	grid-template-areas:
		'h h h'
		'c c s'
		'b1 b2 b3'
		'f f f';
}

.header {
	grid-area: h; 
}
similarly we can point our keyword same as mentioned in grid-template-areas with the classes of the direct child elements like
content, sidebar, boxes, footer
it makes easy to plan out grid layout.

We can use media queries with grid layout as well, redefining our layouts, column widths in media queries according to the 
requirement.


*SASS(Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is CSS preprocessor/precompiler which enhances the functionality of CSS, other
preprocessors include Less, Stylus etc. It allows CSS to work like a programming language, cut down repeated code etc.

It uses .scss(preferred) or .sass file extensions, browser doesn't read SASS file as it reads .css file by adding link to the 
html file, it must be compiled down to regular css and then browser reads it 
TODO: complete remaining section of SASS, I'm leaving it for now as it is not a required section but is advanced/add on section


*CSS animation(transform, transition) don't work with display property.


*animate modal: Following will bring the modal from above from fading and again send above while fading out on close of modal
.modal{
	//other styles
	transition: all 0.3s ease-out; 
}
this says whenever any property changes, animate .modal in 0.3 seconds with ease-out transition, below properties are changing
conditionally that's when animation will be applied

.modal-open{
	opacity: 1;
	transform: translateY(0);//this will bring modal from 0 of the Y-axis
}
.modal-close{
	opacity: 0;
	transform: translateY(-100%); //this will send modal up while closing
}

this is a nice way but limits the animation, if above is our usecase then it will work find


*if we want some more flexibility in animation, we have more control on animation, then we can use the following:
In following we will get our modal from top but it will go little bit lower than our mid point and then animate back to mid point
It will bounce back to desired position

.modal{
	//other styling
	transition: all 0.3s ease-out;
}

.modal-open{
	animation: openModal 0.4s ease-out forwards; 
}
//forwards will make make our modal stay to the final styling, otherwise modal will go back to initial state
.modal-close{
	animation: closeModal 0.4s ease-out forwards;
}

@keyframes openModal {
    0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(-100%); //this will make modal to come from above of the page on Y-axis
    }//this tells how our modal should be in starting state while opening
    50% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(90%); //this will make our modal go more down than the middle
    }//this tells how our modal should be in middle of opening
    100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0); //this will make modal to again come up to the middle
    }//this tells how our modal should be in end after opening
}

@keyframes closeModal {
    0% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
    50% {
        opacity: 0.8;
        transform: translateY(60%);
    }
    100% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(-100%);
    }
}


*for rotating the element (I'm not sure what media query is used for in the following)

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .App-logo {
    animation: App-logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
  }
}

@keyframes App-logo-spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

*few options to opt for verticle middle alignment:
Set the display to "grid" for the grid container, and "flex" for grid items.

verticle-align: middle

margin: auto

display: flex
align-items: center


*flex items overflowing outside div?
apply flex-wrap: wrap on the container

*If you don't want your background opacity to be applied to child elements, use rgba color code for background-color
and in fourth parameter, pass the opacity

*to get the link of the image/pdf or any other file stored in firebase storage
open that file in storage of firebase -> on right window would have opened of the file -> in that window, goto file location section -> copy access token, it
will copy the download url/access url of that file
we can directly use that file in our code url attribute in case of image file
