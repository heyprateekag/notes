*Components are useful because it helps in Reusability(we can use the same component any times in our code, without have to repeat code of
that component multiple times) and it keeps Seperation of concerns(one file doesn't need to contain all the code, each function/tasks can be
divided into different components and therefore will have their code seperate).

*In React, we don't have to define/declare our dom elements in the file like plain JS, we instead make our final dom page and react just uses
that page elements
